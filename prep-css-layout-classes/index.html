        <h3>Raiders of the Lost Ark</h3>
        <p>Ford portrays Indiana Jones, a globe-trotting archaeologist vying with Nazi German forces in 1936 to
        recover the
        long-lost Ark of the Covenant, a relic said to make an army invincible. Teaming up with his tough former
        lover Marion
        Ravenwood (Allen), Jones races to stop rival archaeologist Dr. Ren√© Belloq (Freeman) from guiding the Nazis
        to the Ark
        and its power.</p>

        <h3>Temple of Doom</h3>
        <p>It is the second installment in the Indiana Jones franchise, a prequel to the 1981 film Raiders of the Lost
        Ark,
        featuring Harrison Ford reprising his role as the title character. After arriving in India, Indiana Jones is
        asked by
        desperate villagers to find a mystical stone and rescue their children from a Thuggee cult practicing child
        slavery,
        black magic, and ritualistic human sacrifice in honor of the goddess, Kali.</p>

        <img src="images/crusade.jpg" alt="The last crusade">
        <h3>The Last Crusade</h3>
        <p>After the mixed reaction to Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Spielberg chose to lower the dark tone
        and graphic
        violence in the next installment. During the five years between The Temple of Doom and The Last Crusade, he
        and
        executive producer Lucas reviewed several scripts before accepting Jeffrey Boam's. Filming locations
        included Spain,
        Italy, West Germany, Jordan, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
